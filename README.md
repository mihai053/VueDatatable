# VueJS frontend mini project

## About

My first small VueJS project using basic concepts of vue like routing, props, event handlers, conditional rendering and lifecycle hooks.  
Also for adding a product a modal is showing with a custom form. The datatable is a custom library called **vue3-easy-data-table**.  
You can find the library here: [Datatabel-vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue3-easy-data-table)

## Paths

-> **/** - homepage with a static message that says "This is a CRUD project";  
-> **/product** - a datatable with a list of products and the posibility to Add, Rename and Delete a product;

## Improvments

- using global state management if the app grows;
- better lifecycle updates;
- using vue 3 syntax;

## Extra

This project also has a backend in order to store the products.
